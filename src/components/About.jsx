      <p className='name1'>Hi! I'm Hamza Shahid, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer who
            loves turning ideas into interactive and responsive web experiences.
            I specialize in building modern, user-friendly websites using HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Express. I enjoy creating clean
            designs, writing efficient code, and learning new technologies to
            improve my skills. My goal is to develop web applications that are
            both functional and visually appealing. When I'm not coding, I like
            exploring new tools in web development and improving my
            problem-solving abilities.
